User's must click on the 'Scrape New Articles' button to populate the most recent articles to the page with their headline and summary. Users have the option of saving an article which will then remove the article from the list and add it to the 'Saved Articles' page. Once users are at the 'Saved Articles' page they can delete the article or they can add 'Notes' to the article by pressing the 'Article Notes' button. Users can add multiple notes to an article and have the option to delete notes that have been added.
